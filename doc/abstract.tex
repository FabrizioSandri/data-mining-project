Since the birth of computing, there's always been discussion on how an information system can be used to recommend a product to a customer based on his interests. From the first practical application for a system called Grundy \cite{grundy}, a computer-based library that recommended novels to the users based on their interests, recommendation systems have gained wider attention thanks to the widespread diffusion of internet. Nowadays, these systems are fundamental to the user experience inside web services and social networks. In many cases, recommendation systems are the reason why one service is preferred over another.

The aim of this research is to investigate a new method that aims to enhance query recommendations by first utilizing collaborative filtering, and then incorporating Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) to enhance time performance. The ultimate goal is to increase the accuracy of the recommendations by utilizing a combination of both collaborative filtering and content-based techniques. The findings demonstrate that the proposed method has the potential to generate useful query recommendations, which could be applied in real-world settings.
