\section{Conclusion}

The solutions presented and examined in this research produced satisfactory results, demonstrating how the integration of several data mining approaches may result in an advanced recommendation system that can make meaningful recommendations. The final algorithm was built one block at a time, producing two distinct algorithms: collaborative filtering with LSH, which keeps both a high accuracy and good time performance, and another approach, which has an even greater accuracy but worse time performance (hybrid recommendation). The experiments described in Section \ref{experimental_evalutation} demonstrated how combining a content-based approach with the currently used collaborative filtering method results in a hybrid recommendation system that generates recommendations that are more accurate. Furthermore it was possible to examine the impact of LSH approaches applied to the collaborative filtering method from the perspective of performance in order to quickly exploit similarities between queries based on the ratings contained in the utility matrix. This methodology demonstrated how using these kinds of strategies enables the collaborative filtering method to operate even on massive datasets.
