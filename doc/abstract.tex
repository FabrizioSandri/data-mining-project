Since the birth of computing, there's always been discussion on how an information system can be used to recommend a product to a customer based on his interests. From the first practical application for a system called Grundy \cite{grundy}, a computer-based library that recommended novels to the users based on their interests, recommendation systems have gained wider attention thanks to the widespread diffusion of internet. Nowadays, these systems are fundamental to the user experience inside web services and social networks. In many cases, recommendation systems are the reason why one service is preferred over another.

This research explores a strategy that begins by identifying similar queries using solely LSH with collaborative filtering, then employs a hybrid algorithm that combines both collaborative filtering and content-based techniques to get more accurate recommendations. The results indicate that our method may produce valuable query recommendations, indicating that it has the potential to be used in real-world scenarios.
