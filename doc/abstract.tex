Since the birth of computing, there's always been discussion on how an information system can be used to recommend a product to a customer based on his interests. From the first practical application for a system called Grundy \cite{grundy}, a computer-based library that recommended novels to the users based on their interests, recommendation systems have gained wider attention thanks to the widespread diffusion of internet. Nowadays, these systems are fundamental to the user experience inside web services and social networks. In many cases, recommendation systems are the reason why one service is preferred over another.\\

This paper explores different strategies for integrating several data mining techniques to build a query-based recommendation system, starting with a baseline solution. After introduction to the techniques, we give a formal description of the problem and discuss the possible strategies to solve it. In the final part we examine the quality of the results with particular emphasis on the differences between the baseline solution and the final one. Our results demonstrate that our technique can produce useful query recommendations, demonstrating that it has the potential to be applied in real-world scenarios.
