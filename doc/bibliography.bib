    abstract = {Near-duplicate web documents are abundant. Two such documents differ from each other in a very small portion that displays advertisements, for example. Such differences are irrelevant for web search. So the quality of a web crawler increases if it can assess whether a newly crawled web page is a near-duplicate of a previously crawled web page or not. In the course of developing a near-duplicate detection system for a multi-billion page repository, we make two research contributions. First, we demonstrate that Charikar's fingerprinting technique is appropriate for this goal. Second, we present an algorithmic technique for identifying existing f-bit fingerprints that differ from a given fingerprint in at most k bit-positions, for small k. Our technique is useful for both online queries (single fingerprints) and all batch queries (multiple fingerprints). Experimental evaluation over real data confirms the practicality of our design.},

    abstract = {During the last three or four years several investigators have been exploring “semantic models” for formatted databases. The intent is to capture (in a more or less formal way) more of the meaning of the data so that database design can become more systematic and the database system itself can behave more intelligently. Two major thrusts are clear.In this paper we propose extensions to the relational model to support certain atomic and molecular semantics. These extensions represent a synthesis of many ideas from the published work in semantic modeling plus the introduction of new rules for insertion, update, and deletion, as well as new algebraic operators.},

abstract = {This paper offers a novel look at using a dimensionality-reduction technique called simhash to detect similar document pairs in large-scale collections. We show that this algorithm produces interesting intermediate data, which is normally discarded, that can be used to predict which of the bits in the final hash are more susceptible to being flipped in similar documents. This paves the way for a probabilistic search technique in the Hamming space of simhashes that can be significantly faster and more space-efficient than the existing simhash approaches. We show that with 95\% recall compared to deterministic search of prior work, our method exhibits 4-14 times faster lookup and requires 2-10 times less RAM on our collection of 70M web pages.},
